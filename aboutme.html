					<pre> 
I am from Eliot, Maine which is a small town right next to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. 
Everybody has there one passion growing up, mine was baseball. I started playing when 
I was seven years old, and fell in love with it. I continued to play all through high 
school, where I attended Marshwood High School. I visited the University of Maine the
summer going into senior year, and loved the campus. From there on it was my goal school
to get accepted to. Being here for almost two months now, I can say that I really enjoy it
here, and I am excited for the things to come.
