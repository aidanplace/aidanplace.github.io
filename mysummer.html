				<pre> <strong> Summer 2017 </strong> 
This past summer was a really eventful one for me, 
below are some pictures that detail what I experienced.

This picture was taken when I went on vacation to Cape Cod. 
My family rented a house for the week down there and we 
visited many local spots as well as activities. We rented kayaks
and were kayaking around the various rivers near our house.

The picture above is from a trip my family made in late August. 
We went white water rafting on the Penobscot River. There were
some hiking trails around the campsite and this was one of the peaks.
